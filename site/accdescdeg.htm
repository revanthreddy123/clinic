<!--<li>KLEF offers flexibility for a student to graduate earlier than normal period. In addition to the prescribed courses a student can register for more electives, summer term courses, evening courses and internship program provided his timetable and KLEF facility permits. Students opting for <b>acceleration</b> of degree programme can finish the requirements of degree within the stipulated period and graduate earlier than normal period. </li>-->
<li>	KLEF offers flexibility for all the U.G programs. In addition to the prescribed courses a student can register for more electives, summer term courses, evening courses provided his/her timetable & KLEF facility permits. Any extra courses done by acceleration would be reflected in the transcript but not in the CGPA. Similarly, a student can withdraw from the courses for which he/she has registered or can register for less number of courses to improve his CGPA.</li>
<li>	Number of additional courses for which student can register depends on CGPA and is subjected to the approval of Dean Academics.</li>
<li>	Whenever a student seeks registration for additional courses, he should seek the permission of Dean Academics.</li>
<li>	Synonymous to acceleration of degree program, the KLEF permits a student to decelerate his degree program as well. Any student owing to his personal problems, or any other valid reasons is permitted to withdraw from the courses for which he has registered with the prior approval of Dean Academics . Students who have decelerated their degree program can register for summer term courses and evening courses if KLEF facilities permit and are eligible. Once if they attain normal pace either registration through summer program or through acceleration at subsequent stages, the DDP tag will be removed.
However, when the student is permitted to decelerate his degree program on his request or has been asked to do so by the Dean Academics , he / she has to finish his / her degree program within maximum period of eight years for first degree programs and four years for higher degree programs. Permission or directions from Dean Academics  for deceleration of degree program does not imply that the maximum period is extended.</li>
