																<h1>Change of Branch</h1>
<p>A student admitted to a particular Branch of the B.Tech. Program will normally continue studying in that branch until the completion of the program. However, in special cases the KLEF may permit a student to change from one branch to another after the second semester, provided s/he has fulfilled admission requirement for the branch into which the change is requested. For all UG /PG remaining programs, the change of branch is not applicable.</p>
The rules governing change of branch are as listed below:</p>

<ul>
a)	Top 1% (based on CGPA until 2nd semester) students will be permitted to change to any branch of their choice within the program discipline.<br /><br />
b)	Apart from students mentioned in clause (a) above, those who have successfully completed all the first and second semester courses and with CGPA ≥ 8 are also eligible to apply, but the change of Branch in such case is purely at the discretion of the KLEF.<br /><br />
c)	All changes of Branch will be effective from third semester. Change of branch shall not be permitted thereafter.<br /><br />
d)	Change of branch once made will be final and binding on the student. No student will be permitted, under any circumstances, to refuse the change of branch offered.<br /><br />
e)	Students in clause a and b may be permitted subject to the availability of seats in the desired branch.<br />
