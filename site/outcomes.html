																<h1>Outcome Based Education </h1>
<p>Outcome-Based Education (OBE) is a student-centric teaching and learning methodology in which the course delivery, assessment are planned to achieve stated objectives and outcomes. It focuses on measuring student performance i.e. outcomes at different levels.
</p>

<ul>

<li>	Aligned towards vision and mission of Department and intern to that of the institute 
vision and mission </li>

<li>	Framing Program Educational Objectives (PEO) considers department vision intern institute vision.</li>

<li>	The PEOs, may be guided by global and local needs, vision of the Institution, long term goals etc..</li>

<li>	Program Educational Objectives (PEO) (Not more than 5) which are attainable by students between 3-5 years after graduation.</li>

<li>	Framing Program Outcomes (PO) (PO1 to PO12 are aligned closely with Graduate Attributes of NBA and two to three program specific outcomes (PSO) based on ABET Program Criteria and NBA)</li>

<li>	Design the Curriculum based on the global needs i.e. Consider Local, Regional, National and International requirement time to time from various sources.</li>

<li>	Curriculum Structure is framed by Mapping the Courses identified under various heads vis.a.vis. Basic Sciences, Engineering Sciences, Professional Core, Professional Electives, General Courses, Skill Set Courses, Value addition courses and University Electives</li>
</ul>



<h1>Every Course has the following:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Course Objective  </li>
<li>Course Rationale   </li>
<li>Course Outcomes (CO) (normally 4 to 6 COs depending on the depth and nature of the course) </li>
<li>Course Outcome Indicators (the sub-outcomes under each course outcome exhibited by the student as a result of the evaluation process) </li>
<li>Mapping Course Outcomes to Program Outcomes at appropriate levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy (Level 1: Remembering  Level 2: Understanding, Level 3: Application    Level 4: Analysis, Level 5: Evaluation  Level 6: Creativity / Critical Thinking) </li>
<li>Mapping of Course Outcome Indicator with Course Outcomes at appropriate level of Bloom’s Taxonomy </li>
<li>Defining the best suited Teaching-Learning Styles for each course outcome indicator </li>
<li>Restructuring the topics / content of the course syllabus to fall under appropriate heads of each Course Outcome and in turn under each Course Outcome Indicator. </li>
<li>Preparing the Session wise Delivery Plan, based on the Teaching-Learning styles identified for each Course Outcome Indicator against each topic of the syllabus. </li>
<li>Defining Evaluation procedure under each topic appropriate enough to measure the learning of the students based on the level of Bloom’s Taxonomy and its mapped Course Outcome Indicators, Course Outcomes. </li>
<li>Undertaking Assessment of Students’ learning after each evaluation component, to measure the nature and level of learning taking place at level of each student in each course, and thereby identify the gap and proposing remedial measures to increase the learning process of each student in future assessment. </li>
<li>Undertaking each evaluation component assessment identification shortfalls through gap analysis in that course, it is a continuous process till completion of the course.
<li>Undertaking gap analysis improve students technical knowledge levels, communication skills, decision-making, problem solving, leadership, emotional intelligence, social ethics, Information research skills, ability to learn, teamwork, flexibility, planning skills based on the course outcomes through remedial class , guest lecturers, group discussion, poster presentation,etc.. </li>

<li>Undertaking Course Assessment at the end of each course, and finding out the strengths and shortfalls of the learning taken place, proposing necessary changes in Teaching-Learning Process, Course Content, Topics of the course and implementing them back into the curriculum whenever next, this course if offered. </li>

<li>	At Program level, Assessment of the Program’s delivery at the end of each semester, by taking course assessment reports from each course Instructors team, and identify the levels of expectations fixed, level of learning actually took place and the gaps therein. Thereby propose necessary remedial actions to fill the gap in regard to each course and each student of the course. Also here under, suitable changes in teaching-learning process for each course under each semester of the program will be prepared and  to be dealt from immediate next semester onwards. </li>

<li>	Assess the attainment of Program Education Objectives between 3 to 5 years of graduation for every batch of students and propose suitable changes in delivery methodology for the program and undertake the reformation in entire process listed out as above. </li>

</ul>
