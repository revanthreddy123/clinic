																<h1>Registration Guidelines</h1>
<p>For every course, the student has to undertake the registration process 
prior to commencement of the course-work, based on the following conditions;</p>
<ol type="a" >
	<li>Registration into a course will be permitted 
	only for such courses, which are offered by the program in that particular 
	semester.</li>
	<li>In case a course has pre-requisites, all of 
	them must be fulfilled.</li>
	<li>The KLEF has the right to refuse 
	registration process if a student does not turn up on the day of 
	registration. <u>
	
	</u></li>
	<li>Registration shall not be permitted after the 
	fifth working day from the scheduled date of commencement of classes.
	
	</li>
	<li>Students can register for a maximum of 
	26 credits in a semester of their choice to meet their program requirements.</li>
	<li>In case of students, who wish to 
	register for more credits through Overloading or less credits through 
	Under-loading, have to seek prior permission from Dean-Academics.</li>
	<li>Students, who have opted for minor 
	degree, Honors program or degree with specialisation, can register for more 
	number of credits in a Semester through Overloading.
	
	</li>
	<li>The KLEF reserves the right to 
	withdraw any elective course offered within one week of the commencement of 
	the semester if sufficient numbers of students have not registered or for 
	any other reasons. In such cases, the students are permitted to register for 
	any other elective course of their choice provided they have fulfilled the 
	eligibility conditions.
	
	</li>
	<li>The KLEF reserves the right to 
	cancel the registration of a student from a course or a semester or debar 
	from the degree on disciplinary grounds.</li>
	<li>Within one week of the commencement of 
	the semester, a student is permitted to substitute an&nbsp;elective course 
	subject to availability with prior approval from Dean-Academics. However, a 
	student is not permitted to withdraw from compulsory course and substitute 
	the same with an elective course.
	
	</li>
<li>
A student is solely responsible to ensure that all conditions for proper 
registration are satisfied, and there are no timetable clashes. The registration 
may be cancelled for a course or the entire semester either by the student or by 
the KLEF if any irregularity is found at a later stage. </li>
