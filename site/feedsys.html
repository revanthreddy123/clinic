<h1>Feedback System</h1>
<p>At KLEF, monitoring of feedback is a continuous process. Feedback is obtained from students and parents on various aspects. Feedback is taken through personal interaction with students, interaction with parents in addition to mid-semester and end-semester feedback.</p>
 
<p>The institution assesses the learning levels of the students, after admission and organizes special programs for advanced learners and slow learners.</p>
 
<p>SWEAR analysis should be done for every student in such a way it identifies their interests, pre-existing knowledge, aspects to improve etc. based on their career choice. The following are the different feedbacks: </p>
 <ul>
1. Student General Feedback (Twice in a Sem.)<br />
2. Student Satisfaction Survey (Once in a Sem.) <br />
3. Student Exit Feedback (Once in a Year)<br />

<p>Student Satisfaction Survey (SSS) to all innovative methods and approaches should be recorded at appropriate intervals and the process should be refined based on that. Students should be sensitized on the process and methods and their understanding of the same should be assured. </p>
 
<p>Exit survey feedback to be taken from the final year students on the aspects like entrance test, admission process, Course Contents, Teaching Learning Process, Outcomes, Resources and Evaluation, placements etc.</p>
 
<p>Structured feedback for design and review of syllabus – semester wise / year wise is received from Students, Alumni, Peers, Parent, Industry Personnel.</p>

<p>Parent Teacher Association (PTA) to develop the potential of parents and to strengthen their relationship with their children through planning and conducting a variety of developmental and recreational activities.</p>
<p>Online Feedback is collected from all the students once at the end of the semester using well designed questionnaire. Informal feedback will be collected in parallel from selected student representatives within 4-5 weeks of commencement of the semester by the Office of Dean Academics.</p>
<p>HODs have to submit monthly /semester / Academic Year Feedback reports with necessary comments to Dean Academics office duly signed by concerned Principal/Director.</p>
